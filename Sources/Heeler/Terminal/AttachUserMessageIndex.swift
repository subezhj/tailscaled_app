/// What the user has submitted to one Attach session, so a later frame can be
/// recognised as carrying it.
///
/// The conversation on iOS is a repainted terminal grid, not a message model
/// (ADR 0013). Nothing in the frames marks which rows the user authored: no
/// agent CLI emits OSC 133, and herdr's API exposes no transcript. So the jump
/// control works from what the grid does show — the prompt glyph a TUI draws
/// on the user's own turns — backed by what the app itself sent.
///
/// Two submission paths feed this index, because Agent detail has two:
/// keystrokes crossing `TerminalInputController` (Direct Input, ADR 0016) and
/// Composer sends that leave over `agent.prompt` without touching the PTY.
/// `AgentComposerStore.messages` is not a substitute — it is in-memory, scoped
/// to the Composer, and empty in Direct Input mode.
///
/// Jump targets come from two sources, unioned:
///
/// 1. **Prompt lines seen in a frame.** Every agent TUI Heeler attaches to
///    draws the user's own turns behind a prompt glyph (`>`, `›`, `❯`). A line
///    carrying one is a user message wherever it came from — a desktop herdr,
///    another device, or before the app attached — so scrolling back through
///    history makes that history jumpable. This is the primary source.
/// 2. **Messages this session submitted.** Kept for TUIs that draw no prompt
///    glyph, where source 1 finds nothing.
///
/// Both sources answer ``visibleMessageKeys(_:)`` with *stable identities*
/// rather than a yes/no match, because the jump loop walks by noticing that a
/// message it had not seen has come into view. An identity must therefore not
/// change as a message scrolls in a row at a time: a prompt line's key is
/// derived from that one line, never from how much of the message is on screen.
///
/// Known limits, all of which cost jump-target accuracy rather than correctness
/// elsewhere. A wrong or missing target means a jump scrolls to the top and
/// reports that it found nothing.
///
/// - Direct Input Shift-Enter is a keystroke LF (`AgentQuickKey.shiftEnter`),
///   and a keystroke LF closes the pending line, so one multiline Direct Input
///   message is indexed as its LF-delimited fragments. Making it otherwise would
///   mean guessing intent from a byte that carries none.
/// - While a Composer insert is pending, a write ending on an unresolved `ESC`
///   is read as the Escape *key* and cancels that draft. A CSI or SS3 sequence
///   split exactly at its introducer would therefore be misread during that
///   window. This is the deliberate trade for cancelling a hardware-keyboard
///   Escape, which arrives through Ghostty as anonymous `.keystroke` bytes and
///   is otherwise indistinguishable; no current key producer splits a sequence
///   that way. Pending text from any other source keeps full split tolerance.
/// - A prompt glyph is a heuristic, narrowed by two rules taken from live
///   captures: the glyph must be followed by a space, and it must sit within
///   ``maximumPromptIndent`` columns. Together those reject a `>_ OpenAI
///   Codex` banner and an indented `> /tmp/out.txt` shell redirection. What
///   survives is a flush-left quoted block in agent prose, which costs one
///   surplus press on the walk.
