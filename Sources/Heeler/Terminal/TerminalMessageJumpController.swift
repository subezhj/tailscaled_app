/// repainted frame arrives as ordinary Attach output. So a jump is a loop —
/// push a scroll step, wait for the frame, look at it, repeat.
///
/// Two consequences shape the contract. The loop is **open**: the app cannot
/// learn how many rows a wheel report actually moved, only what came back, so
/// termination is decided from frame content rather than from a row count. And
/// the scroll position is **remote state**, so a jump also moves the same
/// terminal in a desktop herdr window.
