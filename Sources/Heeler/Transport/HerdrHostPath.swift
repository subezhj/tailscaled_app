/// SSH exec is not a login shell: sshd's default `PATH` is typically
/// `/usr/bin:/bin`, so a Host that can run `herdr` interactively still
/// answers `exec: herdr: not found` (exit 127) on Attach. The API socket
/// path does not need the binary — that is why the Console can list Agents
/// while the PTY Attach dies (#206).
///
/// Extra prefixes are appended after the session `PATH` so an existing
/// `herdr` keeps priority. There is no separate probe to discover the
/// `herdr` path; the agent-availability probe reuses this export in its
/// shell body instead of adding another SSH round trip.
///
/// Two ways the prefixes get onto a command, pick by how `herdr` is spelled:
/// - ``wrappingBareHerdr(_:)`` at the exec site when the command *word* is
///   still an unpathed `herdr` (session list, plugin list, and those
///   overrides).
/// - Bake ``pathExport`` into an existing `/bin/sh -c` body when a bare
///   `herdr` or an agent probe lives inside that body. The default plugin
///   config-dir and agent-discovery commands use this form. Wrapping looks
///   only at the command word, so it cannot see an inner `herdr`.
