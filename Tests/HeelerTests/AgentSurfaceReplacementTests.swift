/// What happens when SwiftUI replaces a terminal surface (#152).
///
/// Whole-screen replacement is the one path #143 could not disprove:
/// `AgentTerminalView` holds `@State private var attach`, so an Agent switch
/// releases one store and constructs another, in an order that is SwiftUI's
/// and unspecified. These tests drive that replacement through the real view
/// and observe what the feed does across it.
///
/// A hosted `ConsoleView` was tried first and abandoned: a hosted
/// `NavigationSplitView` builds its columns, separators and navigation bar but
/// never the SwiftUI content inside them, so nothing below it can be observed
/// (measured: 72 views, all chrome, identical with and without a selection).
/// `AgentTerminalView` is not subject to that — it is a plain view and its
/// terminal surface really is built.
